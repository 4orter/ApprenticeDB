# Understand and demonstrate key software design fundamentals

### Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of key software design fundamentals

**Project: [üèó StorefrontAPI](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI)**

This also answers: 
- "Demonstrate successful problem solving behaviors. 1) Demonstrate ability to decompose a problem 2) Demonstrate ability to use abstract data types 3) Demonstrate ability to apply algorithms as a solution 4) Demonstrate ability to follow logical conclusions"

- "Demonstrate the use of an object - oriented language or modelling language to design a model that promotes clean code. 1) Successfully decompose into discrete components in a coherent design that will enable the software to grow and be maintained efficiently"

- "Demonstrate the use of functional programming skills"

-  "Demonstrate ability to recognize and apply design patterns to address a problem"


In the [üèó StorefrontAPI](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI) project, I used software design fundamentals by gathering the requirements for the API, designing and developing the API, testing the API and improving the API as requirements changed. You'll see that I decompose the problem using a Clean Coding principles with [entities](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/entities), [databases](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/frameworks/databases), [repositories](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/frameworks/repositories), [use cases](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/use-cases), [controllers](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/controllers), and [services](https://github.com/4orter/Learning/tree/main/Udacity/Fullstack%20JavaScript%20Nanodegree/StorefrontAPI/src/controllers/services). By using Clean Coding principles, I'm able to scale this API and add new functionality seamlessly. If I wanted to swap out the PostgreSQL database for MongoDB, I can do that without having to refactor other parts of the code.
