### Understand and articulate the value of distributed, modern computing architecture and the role it plays in modern service development

[🎗️ Software Architecture & Design Certificate](/Certificates/Architecture%20Design%20Certificate.pdf)

Distributed architectures like Service-Oriented Architecture and Microservices provide several benefits including scalability, reliability and availability. Microservices, in specific, tries to completely decouple services from each another which can help with service agility, testability and deployment. Separate teams no longer have to constantly coordinate with each other in order to make changes, update, or deploy their service. Since a single request in a distributed architecture may go through several layers of middleware / services, these aren't the most performant architectures. Because there are so many benefits to implementing distributed architecture, especially in the cloud, modern companies like Netflix, AirBnB, and AWS use them.
