# Demonstrate knowledge of key computer programming fundamentals

### Demonstrate an understanding of the history of computing

Computing as seen today is the result of thousands of years of invention and research. Before there were any electronic computers, the term *Computer* referred to a person that calculated numbers or did arithmetic mentally using mathematical formula. Over the millennia, humans would create computing devices like the Abacus (Sumeria), the Difference Engine (Charles Babbage), the Tabulating Machine (Herman Hollerith), and the ENIAC (University of Pennsylvania) to make computing more efficient and less error prone. The invention of mechanical computers would eventually give rise to professions like "Computer Programmer" and "Computer Technician." Early computer programmers like Ada Lovelace typically wrote algorithms that solved mathematic and/or scientific problems. These algorithms or instructions would come to be known as "software." As innovation in computing hardware was giving rise to smaller, cheaper and faster computers, better programming technologies like Assembly language, FORTRAN and COBOL were on the rise and made computer programming more efficient and affordable. Fast forward to the 1970s which gave rise to the more familiar personal computers that we use today that include a graphical user interface. Some of the computers released in that decade include the Apple II and the TRS-80. Newer programming languages like C and BASIC made it easier to program operating systems and applications. Those modern computers and software would then influence modern-day technologies like the Android and iOS operating systems, Windows and Macintosh computers, and programming languages like Java and C#. All of the computing technologies that we take for granted today was built off the back of many people/teams over thousands of years.
