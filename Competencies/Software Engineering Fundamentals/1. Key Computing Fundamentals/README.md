# Demonstrate knowledge of key computer programming fundamentals

### Demonstrate an understanding of the history of computing

Computing as seen today is the result of thousands of years of invention and research. Before there were any electronic computers, the term *Computer* referred to a person that calculated numbers or did arithmetic mentally using mathematical formula. Over the millennia, humans would create computing devices like the Abacus (Sumeria), the Difference Engine (Charles Babbage), the Tabulating Machine (Herman Hollerith), and the ENIAC (University of Pennsylvania) to make computing more efficient and less error prone. The invention of mechanical computers would eventually give rise to professions like "Computer Programmer" and "Computer Technician." Early computer programmers like Ada Lovelace typically wrote algorithms that solved mathematic and/or scientific problems. These algorithms or instructions would come to be known as "software." As innovation in computing hardware was giving rise to smaller, cheaper and faster computers, better programming technologies like Assembly language, FORTRAN and COBOL were on the rise and made computer programming more efficient and affordable. Fast forward to the 1970s which gave rise to the more familiar personal computers that we use today that include a graphical user interface. Some of the computers released in that decade include the Apple II and the TRS-80. Newer programming languages like C and BASIC made it easier to program operating systems and applications. Those modern computers and software would then influence modern-day technologies like the Android and iOS operating systems, Windows and Macintosh computers, and programming languages like Java and C#. All of the computing technologies that we take for granted today was built off the back of many people/teams over thousands of years.

### Demonstrate an understanding of the history and principles of software engineering

The term "Software Engineering" was coined in the 1960s by Margaret Hamilton while she was working on navigational systems at NASA for the Apollo mission. Instead of software being seen as a small component of a bigger system, NASA realized how critical software was in the success of the mission. By the end of the decade, software engineering best practices were being discussed at the NATO Software Engineering Conferences. In the 70s and 80s, modern programming languages like C and C++ are created. These new software technologies enable the development of modern operating system line Unix and other Unix-based systems. In the 1990s while working at CERN, Tim-Berners Lee comes up with the idea of a document information system in which documents/resources link to each other over an internet connection. He creates the first web browser known as "WorldWideWeb" (software) and his ideas ultimately help give rise to what we know as the World Wide Web (internet) today.

There are many different principles within Software Engineering, but the most well knows set of principles within the Software Engineering space is SOLID and DRY. SOLID standing for:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle 
- Dependency Inversion Principle

And DRY for "Don't Repeat Yourself".
